= WARNING: DRAFT =

This is a draft.  A ~dozen of us have discussed this at various times and largely agreed on everything, so it's time to start writing it down.

= Protocol =

The goal of the protocol is to get an [XrdFiles XRD] XML file describing how to find a user's public metadata from that user's email address.

==Split the email address=

Given an email address, *foo@example.com*, split the email address into two parts, the local part (foo) and the domain (example.com)

==Get the domain XRD file==

First, you need to get the domain's XRD file.  In this case, example.com's XRD file.  You try to look that up first using DNS, then falling back to a well-known HTTP URL.

===Try DNS first (if you're feeling fancy)===

On the domain, *example.com*, do a DNS lookup ..... *TODO: complete this section.  SRV doesn't quite work, and TXT is hacky.  See DnsLookup page.*

===Try well-known HTTP location if DNS failed===

If the DNS discovery failed, fallback to HTTP-based domain XRD lookup, using a _well-known location_:

{{{
GET /.well-known/host-meta HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
}}}

The world has enough well-known URLs (`/favicon.ico`, `/crossdomain.xml`, `/robots.txt`), and we felt dirty adding another, so the `/.well-known/` prefix (see [http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-nottingham-site-meta-02.txt draft-nottingham-site-meta-02]) is the virtual directory where we hope future specs add their well-known URLs too.

==Verify the XRD file's signature===

If the XRD file is signed by the domain, check the signature.

If it's not signed and either it's ever been signed before, or it's a big company's site which you expect it to be signed from, be afraid.  Abort the process.  Probably MITM.

Alternatively, request the XRD over SSL, and verify the SSL certificate. This avoids having to do an out-of-band signature process.

==Look for the XRD Link-Pattern==

Look for the Link-Pattern in the domain XRD file.  The Link-Pattern is a template to convert the email address into a URL.

e.g.

{{{
http://meta.example.org/?q={%uri}
}}}

Comment (blaine): is there a way we can define just a Link (i.e., not a Link-Pattern) that always has a single known parameter, as defined by a specific rel tag?

e.g., if the link in an HTML header is:

{{{
<link rel='webfinger-query' href="http://meta.example.org/webfinger' />
}}}

then implicit is an 'email' or 'q' parameter that gets added, like so:

{{{
http://meta.example.org/webfinger?email=bob%40example.org
}}}

==Get user's XRD file==

Expand the Link-Pattern template with the full email address (not just the local, user part), and that's the user's XRD file.

=Appendix=

Respect and use DNS TTLs and HTTP caching/expiry headers.

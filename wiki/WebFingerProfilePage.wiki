#summary WebFinger Profile Page Link Relation

The meaning of the link relation `http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page` is 
the main home/profile page that a human should visit when getting info 
about that webfinger account. It says nothing about the content-type
(or microformats), but it's likely text/html if it's for users.  
But maybe it's just Flash, for instance.
